# Project Kickoff

I am very excited to participate in CSC370. My group will work together to complete a database project with the theme of rating and reviewing movies. Our group consists of three members.

We have planned the entire project into four milestones to meet the requirements of the four assignments. The fourth version will be a fully functional platform as initially envisioned, and we will address potential and unforeseen challenges after the fourth version.

- Learn basic SQL statements.
- Define and document the potential requirements.

**Deliverables:**
- Documented requirements list/table.
- Initial database schema in MySQL.
- Video demonstration of the environment setup and initial schema creation.

### Milestone 2: Building Basic Features
